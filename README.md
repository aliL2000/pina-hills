This file contains the code I used when working on a side project for a friend of mine:

To **test and run** these different Python programs, you'll have to create and activate a virtual environment. To create a **virtual environment**, run this code in the terminal in your place of choice:

```
python -m venv {{NAME_OF_ENV}}
```

Then, activate your environment using this:

```
{{NAME_OF_ENV}}\Scripts\activate
```

Once done, you need to **install** the necessary packages/libraries I commonly use (they can be found in the requirements.txt file)

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

That should provide you with a good enough start! Good luck!
